                <h3>🔐 Data Hiding Technique Using Cryptography and Steganography</h3>
                <p>Developed a secure data hiding system that uses cryptography and steganography to embed and extract confidential messages within images. [cite_start]This project included data encryption using Caesar Cipher, implementation of Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography, and image processing. [cite: 1, 2]</p>
