    <p class="section-description">Below are some of the key projects I worked on during my college education and
        internship experiences. These projects helped me apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems, strengthen
        my technical skills, and collaborate effectively within a team environment.</p>

                <h3>🔐 Data Hiding Technique Using Cryptography and Steganography</h3>
                <p>Developed a secure data hiding system that uses cryptography and steganography to embed and extract
                    confidential messages within images.This project included data encryption using Caesar Cipher,
                    implementation of Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography, and image processing.</p>

                <h3>🛒 Supermarket Billing System</h3>
                <p>Designed a supermarket billing system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and C++.The system
                    features item addition/removal, bill generation, and inventory management.</p>

                <h3>🧩 Sudoku Solver</h3>
                <p>Created a C++ program to solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzles. The program uses a backtracking algorithm and
                    incorporates safety checks for legal number placement.A utility function was developed to display
                    the grid before and after solving.</p>

                <h3>⚠️ Fault Detection in WAAM</h3>
                <p>Engineered a fault detection system for the WAAM process by analyzing welding arc acoustics signals
                    using machine learning algorithms. This project achieved approximately 74% accuracy in detecting
                    faults.</p>
